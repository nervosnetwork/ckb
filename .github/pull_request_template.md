If you're unsure about anything, just ask; somebody should be along to answer within a day or two.

**Important**: We use Squash Merge to merge PRs, so the PR title will become the commit message.
Please ensure your PR title follows the [Conventional Commit Messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.

The most important prefixes you should use:

- `fix:`: represents bug fixes, and results in a SemVer patch bump.
- `feat:`: represents a new feature, and results in a SemVer minor bump.
- `<prefix>!:` (e.g. `feat!:`): represents a breaking change (indicated by the !) and results in a SemVer major bump.

Other conventional prefixes are also acceptable (e.g., `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`, etc.).
