# CKB Core Development

## Running Test

Install dependencies

```
rustup component add rustfmt
rustup component add clippy
```

make ci
```

Run acceptance integration tests

## Chain Spec

The chain spec in `specs/dev.toml` can switch between different PoW engines.
Wiki has the [instructions](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/wiki/PoW-Engines) about how to configure it.

### Well-known Hashes

The command `ckb cli hashes` prints the well-known hashes for current
effective chain spec.

The file `docs/hashes.toml` contains the well-known hashes for all the bundled
chain specs. The file is generated by:

```
cargo run cli hashes -b > docs/hashes.toml
```
