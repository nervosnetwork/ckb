## Cell

### Example

```json
{
    "capacity": 5000000,
    "data": "0x",
    "lock": "0xa58a960b28d6e283546e38740e80142da94f88e88d5114d8dc91312b8da4765a",
    "type": null
}
```

## Description

| Name       | Type       | Description                                                  |
| :--------- | :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `capacity` | uint64     | **The size of the cell.** When a new cell is generated (via transaction), one of the verification rule is `capacity ≥ len(capacity)+len(data)+len(type)+len(lock)`. This value also represents the balance of CKB coin, just like the `balance` field in the Bitcoin's UTXO. (E.g. Alice owns 100 CKB coins means she can unlock a group of cells that has 100 amount of `capacity` in total.) |
| `data`     | Bytes      | **Arbitrary data.** This part is for storing states or scripts.  In order to make this cell valid on-chain, the data filled in this field should comply with the logics and rules defined by `type` or `lock`. |
| `type`     | `Script`   | **A Script that defines the type of the cell.** In a transaction, if an input cell and an output cell has the same `type` field, then the `data` part of these two cells is limited by the `type` script upon the transaction verification. (I.e. `type` is a script that limits how the `data` field of the new cells can be changed from the old cells.) `type` is required to has a data structure of `script`. **This field is optional.** |
| `lock`     | H256(hash) | **The hash of a Script that defines the ownership of the cell**, just like the `lock` field in the Bitcoin's UTXO. Whoever can provide an unlock script that has the same hash of a cell's `lock` hash can use this cell as input in an transaction (i.e. has the ownership of this cell). This is similar to the P2SH scheme in Bitcoin. |

## Script

### Example

```json
{
  "version": 0,
  "reference": "0x12b464bcab8f55822501cdb91ea35ea707d72ec970363972388a0c49b94d377c",
  "signed_args": [
    "024a501efd328e062c8675f2365970728c859c592beeefd6be8ead3d901330bc01"
  ],
  "args": [
    "3044022038f282cffdd26e2a050d7779ddc29be81a7e2f8a73706d2b7a6fde8a78e950ee0220538657b4c01be3e77827a82e92d33a923e864c55b88fd18cd5e5b25597432e9b",

  ]
}
```



### Description

| Name          | Type    | Description                                                  |
| :------------ | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`     | uint8   | **The version of the script.** It‘s used to distinguish transactions when there's a fork happened to the blockchain system. |
| `binary`      | Bytes   | **ELF formatted binary that contains an RISC-V based script.** This part of data is loaded into an CKB-VM instance when they are specified upon the transaction verification. |
| `reference`   | Bytes   | **The `type hash` of the script that is referred by this script.** It is possible to refer the script in another cell on-chain as the binary code in this script, instead of entering the binary directly into the script. **Notice:** This is part only works when the `binary` field is empty. |
| `args`        | [Bytes] | **An array of arguments as the script input.** The arguments here are imported into the CKB-VM instance as input arguments for the scripts. This part is NOT used when calculating the hash of the script. |
| `signed_args` | [Bytes] | **An array of arguments that belongs to the script for improving code reuse rate**. Please refer [this document](https://github.com/Mine77/ckb-demo-ruby-sdk/blob/docs/update-docs/docs/how-to-write-contracts.md#script-model) for more explanation about this field. |

### Description

#### Transaction

| Name              | Type                             | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `version`         | uint32                           | **The version of the transaction.** It‘s used to distinguish transactions when there's a fork happened to the blockchain system. |
| `deps`            | [`outpoint`]                     | **An array of `outpoint` that point to the cells that are dependencies of this transaction.** Only live cells can be listed here. The cells listed are read-only. |
| `inputs`          | [{`previsou_output` , `unlock`}] | **An array of {`previsou_output` , `unlock`}.**              |
| `previous_output` | `outpoint`                       | **A cell outpoint that point to the cells used as inputs.** Input cells are in fact the output of previous transactions, hence they are noted as `previous_output` here. These cells are referred through  `outpoint`, which contains the transaction `hash` of the previous transaction, as well as this cell's `index` in its transaction's output list. |
| `unlock`          | `script`                         | **A script for unlocking the corresponding input cell** (i.e. `previous_output`). See [here](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-demo-ruby-sdk/blob/develop/docs/how-to-write-contracts.md) for how to program this part. |
| `outputs`         | [`cell`]                         | **An array of cells that are used as outputs**, i.e. the newly generated cells. These are the cells may be used as inputs for other transactions. |



#### OutPoint



| Name             | Type               | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `outpoint`       | {`hash` , `index`} | **An outpoint is pointer to a specific cell.** This is used in a transaction to refer a cell that is generated in a previous transaction. |
| `outpoint.hash`  | H256(hash)         | **The hash of the transaction that this cell belongs to.**   |
| `outpoint.index` | uint32             | **The index of the cell in its transaction's output list.**  |

### Description

#### Block

| Name                    | Type            | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `header`                | `Header`        | **The block header of the block.** This part contains some metadata of the block. |
| `commit_trasactions`    | [`Transaction`] | **An array of transactions contained in the block.** This is where the miner put the received transactions. |
| `proposal_transactions` | [string]        | **An array of hex-encoded short transaction ID.**            |
| `uncles`                | [`UncleBlock`]  | **An array of uncle blocks of the block.**                   |

#### Header

| Name           | Type                | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `cellbase_id`  | H256(hash)          | **The hash of the Cellbase transaction.** Cellbase transaction is just like the coinbase transaction in Bitcoin. It's the transaction added by the miner who mined this block, by which the miner receives block reward for successfully mined the block. |
| `difficulty`   | Bytes               | **The difficulty of the PoW puzzle.**                        |
| `hash`         | H256(hash)          | **The block hash.** Note that although this value is returned by the JSON-RPC API, it is in fact NOT a part of the header. This value is actually calculated from the `Header` data. |
| `number`       | uint64              | **The block height.**                                        |
| `parent_hash`  | H256(hash)          | **The hash of the parent block.**                            |
| `seal`         | `nonce` and `proof` | **The seal of a block.** After finished the block assembling, the miner can start to do the calculation for finding the solution of the PoW puzzle. The "solution" here is called `seal`. |
| `seal.nonce`   | uint64              | **The nonce.** Similar to [the nonce in Bitcoin](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Nonce). |
| `seal.proof`   | Bytes               | **The solution of the PoW puzzle.**                          |
| `timestamp`    | uint64              | **A [Unix time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) timestamp.** |
| `txs_commit`   | H256(hash)          | **The Merkle Root of the Merkle trie with the hash of transactions as leaves.** |
| `txs_proposal` | H256(hash)          | **The Merkle Root of the Merkle trie with the hash of short transaction IDs as leaves.** |
| `uncles_count` | uint32              | **The number of uncle blocks.**                              |
| `uncles_hash`  | H256(hash)          | **The hash of the serialized uncle blocks data.** This will later be changed to using [CFB Encoding](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/cfb). |
| `version`      | uint32              | **The version of the block**. This is for solving the compatibility issues might be occurred after a fork. |

#### UncleBlock

| Name                    | Type          | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `header`                | `Header`      | **The block header of the uncle block.**                     |
| `proposal_transactions` | [`string`]    | **An array of short transaction IDs of the transactions in the uncle block.** |
