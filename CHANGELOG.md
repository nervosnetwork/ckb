## [v0.1.0-pre10](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/compare/v0.1.0-pre09...v0.1.0-pre10) (2018-11-01)

In this release, we added syscalls which allow contract reads cells. We are working on contract SDK, and an RPC is added to get the cells. We also did many refactorings to make the code base easier to improve in the future.

- Feature: Add an intermediate layer between the app and libp2p. @jjyr
- Feature: Use custom serialization for the redeem script hash instead of bincode.
  @xxuejie
- Feature: Add logs when pool rejects transactions.
  @xxuejie
- Feature: Add RPC to get cells by the redeem script hash. @xxuejie
- Feature: Implement `mmap_tx`/`mmap_cell` syscall to read cells in contract.
  @zhangsoledad
- Refactoring: Replace RUSTFLAGS with cargo feature. @quake
- Refactoring: Tweek Cuckoo. @quake
- Refactoring: Rename TipHeader/HeaderView member to `inner`. @quake
- Refactoring: Refactor `ckb-core`. Eliminate public fields to ease future
  refactoring. @quake
- Bug: Add proper syscall number checking in VM. @xxuejie
- Bug: Generate random secret key if not set. @jjyr
- Bug: Fix input signing bug. @xxuejie
- Test: Replace quickcheck with proptest. @zhangsoledad

VM & Contract:

- Feature: Build a mruby based contract skeleton which provides a way to write full Ruby contract @xxuejie
- Feature: Build pure Ruby `secp256k1-sha3-sighash_all` contract @xxuejie

## [v0.1.0-pre07](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/compare/v0.1.0-pre06...v0.1.0-pre07) (2018-09-17)

This release introduces the consensus rule that transactions must be proposed via blocks first.

PoW is refactored to ease switching between different implementations.

ckb:

- Feature: UTXO index cache @knwang
- Feature: Adapter layer for different PoW engines @quake
- Feature: Cuckoo builtin miner @quake
- Test: Network integration test @TheWaWaR
- Test: Nodes integration test @zhangsoledad
- Chore: Upgrade libp2p wrapper @TheWaWaR
- Chore: Switch to Rust stable channel. @zhangsoledad
- Chore: Setup template for the new crate in the repository. @zhangsoledad

ckb-riscv:

- Feature: Implement RISC-V syscalls @xxuejie

## [v0.1.0-pre03](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/compare/v0.1.0-pre02...v0.1.0-pre03) (2018-07-22)

It is a version intended to be able to mint and transfer cells.

It has two limitation:

- The node stops work randomly because of network disconnecting bug.
- Cell is not signed and spending is not verified.
