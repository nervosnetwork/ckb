    For compatibility reasons, there're certain bugs that we have to leave
    to the next hardfork to fix. However those bugs, especially VM bugs
    might lead to surprising unexpected behaviors. This change adds a new
    checker that checks against newly created cells for scripts with bugs,
    and reject those transaction when we can. This way we can alert users
    about the bugs as early as we can.

### Breaking Changes

* #1585: Include fractions in epoch number representations (@xxuejie)

    This change introduce fractions in 2 places where epoch numbers might
    be used:

    * The epoch field in the header
    * Cell input's since part when using epoch values

    Here we use a rational number format to represent epoch number.
    The lower 54 bits of the epoch number field are split into 3
    parts(listed in the order from higher bits to lower bits):

    * The highest 16 bits represent the epoch length
    * The next 16 bits represent the current block index in the epoch
    * The lowest 24 bits represent the current epoch number

    Assuming we are at block number 11555, epoch 50, and epoch 50 starts
    from block 11000, has a length of 1000. The epoch number for this
    particular block will then be 9326559282, which is calculated
    in the following way:

    ```
    50 | ((11555 - 11000) << 24) | (1000 << 16)
    ```

* #1643: Compress header (@zhangsoledad)

### Features

* #1119: Remove rules of special reserve blocks (@doitian)

    This is a breaking change: b:consensus, b:database

    For block 1~11, the reward target is genesis block. Genesis block must have the lock serialized in the cellbase witness, which is set to `bootstrap_lock`.

### Improvements

* #1072: Reveal network errors and involver handle it (@keroro520)

    * feat: Reveal network errors. Currently, when `CKBProtocolContext` receives an error from p2p, it only logs the error and doesn't return to the caller. I change to `CKBProtocolContext` return the error to the caller, and caller handles it.

    * perf: Short-circuiting break if occurs network error, `Synchronizer` responses `Blocks` and `Transactions`. This is the original intention of this PR. To achieve it, I have to make  `CKBProtocolContext` reveals the network errors, which introduces most of the change code.

# [v0.15.0](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/compare/v0.14.0...v0.15.0) (2019-06-29)

**Important:** The default secp256k1 has changed. Now its code hash is

    0x94334bdda40b69bae067d84937aa6bbccf8acd0df6626d4b9ac70d4612a11933

### Highlights

* #922: Feat: proposer reward (@zhangsoledad)

    This is a breaking change: b:consensus

    1. earliest transaction proposer get 40% of the transaction fee as a reward.
    2. block reward finalized after proposal window close.
    3. enforce one-input one-output one-witness on cellbase.

* #1054: Replace system cell (@driftluo, @jjyr)

    See [feat: use recoverable signature to reduce tx size by jjyr · Pull Request #15 · nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/pull/15)

# [v0.14.0](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/compare/v0.13.0...v0.14.0) (2019-06-15) rylai-v3

### BREAKING CHANGES

**Important**: The default secp256k1 code hash is changed to `0xf1951123466e4479842387a66fabfd6b65fc87fd84ae8e6cd3053edb27fff2fd`. Remember to update block assembler config.

This version is not compatible with v0.13.0, please init a new CKB directory.

### Features

* #913: New verification model (@xxuejie)

    This is a breaking change: b:consensus, b:database, b:p2p, b:rpc

    Based on feedbacks gathered earlier, we are revising our verification
    model with the following changes:

    * When validating a transaction, CKB will grab all lock scripts from
      all inputs, and group them based on lock script hash. The script in
      each group will only be run once. The lock script itself will have
      to do the validation task for all inputs in the same group
    * CKB will also grab all type scripts from inputs and outputs(notice
      different from previous version, the type scripts in inputs are
      included here as well), and group them based on type script hash as
      well. Each type script in each group will also be run once. The type
      script itself needs to handle the validation task within the group
    * Syscalls are also revised to allow fetching all the
      inputs/outputs/witnesses within a single group.
    * Input args is removed since the functionality can be replicated elsewhere

* #908: Peers handle disconnect (@keroro520)
* #891: Secp256k1 multisig (@jjyr)
* #845: Limit TXO set memory usage (@yangby-cryptape)

    1. get rid uncle age limit
    2. try include disconnected block as uncle

* #920: Tweak consensus params (@zhangsoledad)

    This is a breaking change: b:consensus

    tweak `block_cycles_limit` and `min_block_interval`

* #897: Wrap the log macros to fix ill formed macros (@yangby-cryptape)

* #926: Make a better error message for miner when method not found (@yangby-cryptape)
* #961: Display miner worker status (@quake)

    BREAKCHANGE: config file `ckb-miner.toml` changed

* #1001: `ckb init` supports setting block assembler (@doitian)

    - `ckb init` accepts options `--ba-code-hash` and `--ba-arg` (which can
    repeat multiple times) to set block assembler.
    - `ckb cli secp256k1-lock` adds an output format `cmd` to prints the
    command line options for `ckb init` to set block assembler.

    The two commands can combine into one to init the directory with a secp256k1 compressed pub key:

        ckb init $(ckb cli secp256k1-lock <pubkey> --format cmd)

* #996: Tweak consensus parameters (@doitian)

    - Change target epoch duration to 4 hours
    - Reduce epoch reward to 1/4
    - Increase secondary epoch reward to 600,000 bytes


### Bug Fixes

* #878: Calculate the current median time from tip (@keroro520)

    This is a breaking change: b:consensus

    Original implementation use `[Tip-BlockMedianCount .. Tip-1]` to calculate the current block median time. According to the notion of BlockMedianTime in [bip-0113](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki#specification) , here change to use `[Tip-BlockMedianCount+1 .. Tip]` instead.

### Bug Fixes

* #812: Prof should respect script config (@xxuejie)
* #810: Discard invalid orphan blocks (@keroro520)

    When accepts a new block, its descendants should be accepted too if valid. So if an error occurs when we try to accept its descendants, the descendants are invalid.

* #850: Ensure EBREAK has proper cycle set (@xxuejie)

    This is a breaking change: b:consensus

    This is a bug reported by @yangby-cryptape. Right now we didn't assign proper cycles for EBREAK, which might lead to potential bugs.

* #344: Revise script structure r=xxuejie a=xxuejie

* #425: Bundle app config in compiled binary a=doitian

### Improvements

* #392: avoid recursive lock a=zhangsoledad

### BREAKING CHANGES

This release has changed core data structure, please delete the old data directory.

The testnet chain spec is also changed, which is incompatible with previous versions.

Command line argument `-c` is removed, and a new command line argument `-C` is added. See `ckb help` for details.

Now the command `ckb` no longer searches the config file `nodes/default.toml`. It looks for the config file `ckb.toml` or `ckb-miner.toml` in current directory and uses the default config options when not found. A new command `ckb init` is added, see its usage with `ckb init --help`.

Config file `ckb.toml` changes:

- Removed `logger.file`, `db.path` and `network.path` from config file.
- Added config option `logger.log_to_stdout` and `logger.log_to_file`.
- Section `block_assembler` now accepts two options `binary_hash` and `args`.
- Added a new option to set sentry DSN.

File `miner.toml` changes:

- Option `spec` is moved under `chain`, which is consistent with `ckb.toml`.
- Move miner own config options under section `miner`.
- Remove `logger.file` from config file.
- Add config option `logger.log_to_stdout` and `logger.log_to_file`.

It is recommended to export the config files via `ckb init`, then apply the
modifications upon the new config files.


# [v0.8.0](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/compare/v0.7.0...v0.8.0) (2019-04-08)

### Features

* #336: index whether a tx is a cellbase in the chain r=quake a=u2

    Index whether a tx is a cellbase in the chain, prepare for the cellbase outputs maturity checking.

    Now saving the cellbase index and block number in the `TransactionMeta`, there is another implementation which creates a `HashMap<tx_hash, number>`. The second one may be a little memory saving, but this one is more simple. I think both are ok.
