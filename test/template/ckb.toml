# Set the lock script to protect mined CKB.
#
# CKB uses CS architecture for miner. Miner process (ckb miner) gets block
# template from the Node process (ckb run) via RPC. Thus the lock script is
# configured in ckb.toml instead of ckb-miner.toml, and the config takes effect
# after restarting Node process.
#
# The `code_hash` identifies different cryptography algorithm. Read the manual
# of the lock script provider about how to generate this config.
#
# CKB provides an secp256k1 implementation, it requires a hash on the
# compressed public key. The hash algorithm is blake2b, with personal
# "ckb-default-hash". The first 160 bits (20 bytes) are used as the only arg.
#
# You can use any tool you trust to generate a Bitcoin private key and public
# key pair, which can be used in CKB as well. CKB CLI provides the function for
# you to convert the public key into block assembler configuration parameters.
#
# Here is an example using ckb-cli to generate an account, this command will
# print the block assembler args(lock_arg) to screen:
#
#     ckb-cli account new
#
# If you already have a raw secp256k1 private key, you can get the lock_arg by:
#
#     ckb-cli util key-info --privkey-path <privkey-path>
#
# The command `ckb init` also accepts options to generate the block assembler
# directly. See `ckb init --help` for details.
#
#     ckb init <lock_arg>
