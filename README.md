## About CKB

CKB is a public and permissionless layer-1 blockchain. CKB uses [Proof of Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) and [improved Nakamoto consensus](https://medium.com/nervosnetwork/breaking-the-throughput-limit-of-nakamoto-consensus-ccdf65fe0832) to achieve maximized performance on average hardware and network bandwidth, without sacrificing layer-1's core values - decentralization and security.

CKB supports scripting in any programming language with its own [CKB-VM](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-vm/), a virtual machine fully compatible with RISC-V ISA.
CKB is a [Universal Verification Layer](https://medium.com/nervosnetwork/https-medium-com-nervosnetwork-cell-model-7323fca57571) which focuses on verification, leaves computation to layer 2 (and higher) applications/protocols.

[CKB](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0002-ckb/0002-ckb.md) is a part of [Nervos Network](https://www.nervos.org), which defines [a suite of scalable and interoperable blockchain protocols](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs) to create a self-evolving distributed economy.

Support for different platforms are organized into [three tiers](docs/platform-support.md), each with a different set of guarantees.

**Notice**: The ckb process will send stack trace to sentry on Rust panics. This is enabled by default before the mainnet launch, which can be opted out by setting
the option `dsn` to empty in the config file.

## Join a Network

- Mainnet Mirana: Use the [latest release](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/releases/latest) and run `ckb init --chain mainnet` to initialize the node.
    - Mirana is active since the epoch 5414, see the [migration guide](https://github.com/jordanmack/nervos-ckb2021-hard-fork-migration-guide) to upgrade from Lina.
- Testnet Pudge: Use the [latest release](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/releases/latest) and run `ckb init --chain testnet` to initialize the node.
    - Pudge is active since the epoch 3113.


## Mining

CKB uses the [Eaglesong](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0010-eaglesong/0010-eaglesong.md) mining algorithm.


## Development Process

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested. It is considered already production ready; The `develop` branch is the work branch to merge new features, and it's not stable. The CHANGELOG is available in [Releases](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/releases) and [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) in the `master` branch.


## How to Contribute

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), and security policy is described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). To propose new protocol or standard for Nervos, see [Nervos RFC](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs).
